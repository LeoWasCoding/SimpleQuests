|------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| `/quest`         | Open the available quests menu    | `simplequests.command.quest`     |
| `/addquest`      | Add a new quest                   | `simplequests.command.addquest`  |

## How to Use
1. Install **FormAPI** by [jojoe77777](https://github.com/jojoe77777/FormAPI) (Required).
2. Place the plugin `.phar` or folder into your `plugins/` directory.
3. Start your server.
4. Use `/addquest` to create a new block-breaking quest.
5. Players use `/quest` to view and accept quests.

## Quest Types
Currently supported quest types:
- üß± Break specific blocks (`BREAK_BLOCK`)

*More types (e.g., Place blocks, Kill mobs) can be added in future updates!*

## Quest Cooldowns
You can set cooldowns for quests (e.g., "1s", "5m", "2h").  
This prevents players from instantly repeating quests after completing them.

## File Structure
- `progress.json`: Stores each player's active quest progress.
- `lastCompleted.json`: Stores timestamps of quest completions to handle cooldowns.
- `config.yml`: Stores all quests and their settings.

## Dependencies
- [FormAPI](https://github.com/jojoe77777/FormAPI) by jojoe77777

## Permissions
Make sure to set the right permissions for your players/admins to control who can add, edit, or delete quests.

## Example Quest Creation
When creating a quest:
- **Name**: "Mine 10 Stone Blocks"
- **Description**: "Break stones to earn rewards."
- **Block**: `STONE`
- **Target**: `10`
- **Reward Command**: `give {player} diamond 1`
- **Reward Message**: "You've earned a diamond!"
- **Cooldown**: `10m` (optional)
